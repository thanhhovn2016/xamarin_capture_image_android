cropimage
=========

Easy to use library for image cropping on Android apps built with Xamarin.

Android does not offer a built-in activity for image cropping (there
is no guarantee that "com.android.camera.action.CROP" is present) so
you have to build your own.

This library is a simplified port of the project found at
https://github.com/MMP-forTour/cropimage.
